# Discord OAuth Fix

This change triggers a fresh build to resolve the Discord OAuth redirect issue.

The problem was that the previous build contained hardcoded localhost:3000 URLs because it was built before the environment variables were correctly configured.

## Changes Made:
- Environment variables are correctly set in Render
- Discord app redirect URIs are properly configured  
- This commit forces a rebuild with correct NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI

Expected result: Discord OAuth will now redirect to production URL instead of localhost:3000.
